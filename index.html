        <p>Today is a busy day. Getting up at about 7, I normally had a breakfast. Then I went to the classroom, trying to take a class. However, due fully to the way our teacher taught, I left the class at the break, and went to the lab. </p>
<p>To continue the yesterday’s work, I ran VS2013, and coded with opencv. Because of the lack of creation of my work, I couldn’t be absolutely focused. And, since I hadn’t read the article about the method for a long time, despite my appreciation to it, I couldn’t understand it. To end the project, I held on.</p>
<p>At about 2 p.m, mission complete. Then, endless test and debug began. Through comparing the result of my work with the matlab counterpart, I need to correct the faults one by one. In order to refine some bizarre faults, I even had to define some new function. For example, to got the gradient of an image, I need the diffenrence of it. At first, I thought convolving an image with a sobel operator might lead to the same consequence. But it seemed I was wrong. Moreover, how to organize the function was another question. I believed that I would obtain a lot by writing a lib myself.</p>
<p>After dinner, I went back to the lab, went on the test works. Eventually, after eliminating the last mistake, I successfully ran the program. But to my surprise, the algorithm written in C++ wasn’t as effective as in MATLAB. I couldn’t believe what I saw since theoretically the compiling language should be more effective than interpretive ones. Hence I decided to ask the professor tomorrow.</p>
<p>I began to join the online test of Tencent intern recruit at 7. Although what I petitioned was background develop, there were some questions about OC,JS or JAVA included. It made me really out of sourts. Luckily enough, the following questions were more relating to C and CPP.</p>
<p>Just recently, I noticed that my state in Alibaba intern recruit was changed into interview scheduling, which showed that I passed the prelim. </p>
<p>英语已废。今日腾讯30个不定项选择着实折腾，而且考试还要开摄像头，限制切换页面。可以说考的内容让我觉得很奇怪，毕竟至少一半是完全在蒙的。剩下的选择和问答还好点，C，C++不算难吧。没想到阿里竟然过了，幸亏面试还有快1个月，可以准备一下了。</p>

        <p>Today I got up at 7’o clock, and quickly had a breakfast. Then I came to the lab, starting to learn and work.</p>
<p>Before 10, I mainly focused on leap motion, trying to combine it with opencv lib to make a program where swiping the fingers could make a picture blurry or sharp. Although the expectation seemed good, the fact was that my leap motion couldn’t work as I thought. After times of refining, I still couldn’t solve the problem. Hence, I decided to pause, and turn to my main program.</p>
<p>Then I began to go on rewriting the DRLSE algorithm with C++. Last days, I attempted to customize my own class and operator, and had written part of them. However, when I eventually realized that I couldn’t load the image, I gave up all of them. After yesterday’s work, tasks need doing today was not much. </p>
<p>During coding, I gradually felt the merit of C++, especially the template and overload. As a skilled C programmer, I coudn’t express my excitement when I really had grasp of these features. Also, the polymorphism of class caught my attention, since it was an accurate reflection of the natural world.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I attended the CPP class, learning something about the overload of operator. Despite the fact that I had already programmed with this method, I didn’t realize that I made lots of faults until today. As a class function, if it was not declared as friend, the parameters wouldn’t include the class itself because of the exist of this pointer. Such details was not easy to remember out of the classroom; therefore, I should join in more classes.</p>
<p>In the pre-evening and evening, I continued coding, and there were nothing else.</p>
<p>总之今天过得比较典型，编程中对C++的一些特性有了更好的掌握。下午上课时通过翻书也加深了以前不在乎的个别细节的了解。</p>

        <p>Long time no see. During the Qingming holiday, I didn’t do something worth recording. On Thursday of the last week, I finished my last daily report at noon on the train. And in the evening, I participated in the test of Alibaba’s intern qualification. To be honest, I tried my best but did not solve anyone of the 3 programming quiz, although I had idea of one. It was reasonable and receivable that I might lost the chance, since I didn’t really delve into algorithm.</p>
<p>However, what happened the next day was undoubtedly frustrated. Because of the error made by Tencent of email classification, my invitation email was regarded as junk mail and put into the trash bin. As a result, I missed the little opportunity of working in Microsoft. It made me furious at that time, but after about 5 minutes, I settled down, and realized that it might only prevent me from daydreaming.</p>
<p>Then, the other 2 days, Saturday and Sunday, I worked on opencv and leap motion. It took lots of times to download the VS2013 and built the environment. After dealing with the basic staff, I eventually began coding with the API’s provided by leap motion. Admittedly, the coding style seemed fantastic, which was not only accurate but also concise. Leap motion itself, the hardware, was cool too. Although I coudln’t handle it until now, I didn’t think it was hard. In the near future, I will make it work with cv.</p>
<p>总之，这几天过的比较随意，基本进入放假状态。实习的事可以不用考虑了，毕竟投入有限，之前的期望也有点不切实际。微软的题目后来看了一下，估计时间充足也没法做，所以错过虽然很郁闷，但也没什么实质损失。未来几天把DRLSE的C++搞定测试一下吧。ML的课也要继续了。</p>

        <p>由于身体不适，两天没写，今天补一点吧。</p>
<p>Now I’m on the train, travelling to Zhengzhou. Last 3 days, I suffered from fever and cold, and felt not so good. I was internally afraid of fever ever since the bad time in 2012. Hence, not until my body temperature was back to normal could I relax.</p>
<p>这几天几乎什么都没看吧。昨天好了点之后看了看C++，不过感觉根本看不进去。专业课也根本听不懂，傅里叶什么的有种要忘光的感觉。今晚阿里明天微软简直爽翻天。原来打算趁着最后几天临阵抱佛脚，结果一场小病让我只能去裸考了。</p>

        <p>Today is a rainy day. I got up not so early in the morning, and after having a breakfast, I went to the lab. Turning on my surface, I found the upgrade of the problem on hihocoder, so I started coding to solve the problem. Today’s problem was related to merge sort, which I written yesterday. Hence I quickly came up with an idea, and implemented it. However, things didn’t happen as I wanted. At first, I made a stupid mistake where I wrongly valued a variable, conducting to the runtime error over and over again. After I corrected it, I still coudn’t get my answer accepted. In fact, I have had no idea of where my fault is up to now. This strange failure proved me the difference between thorem and practice.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, due to my unexpected failure, I was to some extent disappointed. Hence I stopped studying and surfed the internet. After hours of distraction and sleep, I restarted to studying. I went on watching the open course of ML following yesterday’s progress. And the lecture mainly covered the topic of SVM. To pose the concept of suppor vectors, Andrew Ng introduced general Lagrange mutipliers, which deals with both limit of equations and inequations, as well as the KKT condition. Admittedly, all of the knowledge mentioned in this lecture was quite hard to understand, thus I should recap them regularly. </p>
<p>After dinner, I turned to the field of algorithm, studying some linear time complexity sort algorithm and hash table, and in retrospect, I had a look at some simple data structres such as link list, stack and queue. In my opinion, these sorting methods are so efficient. Despite the unavoidable constraints, each of them has specific use, according to the type of data. And I think the counting method is the most ingenious one.</p>
<p>The hash table is also interesting, so I want to delve into it tomorrow.</p>
<p>今天废话好多。。各种忘词忘得烦，不说了</p>

        <p>What I did today was divided by a lunch. Before it, I was focused on sorting algorithm, writing all of the algorithms I knew including insert sort, bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort. Although I haven’t tested them, I’m confident that I thoroughly understand all of them.</p>
<p>And in the afternoon, after playing cell phones for hours, I began to watch the open course provided by Stanford about Machine learning. This time, I learned naive bayes method, an introduction to neural network, and a getting started of SVM( support vector machine). Naive Bayes is, in Andrew Ng’s words, built on a strong assumption, where each of the words in a text is conditionally independent. Also, according to him, it is a practical learning algorithm. Although the numerical calculations may by someway difficult, the theorem itself is relatively easy, based on Bayes theory. Meanwhile, Andrew Ng introduced another model, which was based on multinomial distribution rather than multivariate gaussian one. This method behaved better in text detection, despite its neglect of the sequential factor.</p>
<p>Then he mentioned neural network, where the working mechnism was similar to logic regression, which was based on sigmoid function. And, in order to solve linearly inseperable problems, multilayer network was introduced, and also the back propagation algorithm, another name of gradient descent algorithm in a different condition. Then, it came to the distance in multidimensional problems, ending with the compare of functional and geometric margin.</p>
<p>To be honest, what I can do now may be only remember some terms without truely understanding them. Thus I need time to digest them. At the end, I want to state something I sadly find out today, which is the fact that maybe the real reason for my poor writing is not the low level in my English, on the other hand, it should be attributed to my inability of organizing words. I should do more writing everyday, both in Chinese and English.</p>
<p>今天看到神经网络的内容，正好与之前在书上看到的对应了起来，果然也印证了我对BP与GDA(Gradient descent algorithm)相类似的看法。但同时，我发现我的遗忘又开始了，即使是当初搞得挺明白的BP也是如此。上午终于把几种O(n2)和O(nlgn)的排序“遍历”了一遍，感觉有点底了。同时还看了场火箭的胜利，可喜可贺。经过几天的酝酿，一个opinion的主题逐渐在我心中形成了，趁这个周末抓紧搞出来吧，尽量双语。ML的数学部分还是有不解的，尤其是对标量求矢量偏导导，结果还能是标量的奇怪问题，应速解决。晚上乱扔了几个球，果然比去完健身房之后准不少。</p>

        <p>Yesterday I suffered from the book Introduction to Algorithm, and was too tired to write something. </p>
<p>Due to the vacancy of classes, I stayed in the lab for whole day, and concentrated on algorithm. Firstly, I attempted to solve some difficult questions corresponding to the intern test. Although I tried my best, I couldn’t even one of them. That helped my realize the great importance of foundation. Thus I started reading the book mentioned above, tried to understand the method and theorem, and sometimes typed some codes on computer to be familiar with them. After dinner, I left the lab and went to the classroom, getting rid of the computer screen and enjoying the pure reading. I quickly browsed most of sorting algorithms and understood them at least in theory.</p>
<p>终于补上了昨天该写的。近日在各方面的问题上陷入了迷茫，到底是图像、算法还是ML或AI，难以抉择啊。自从听了微软的宣讲，虽然认识到希望的渺茫，但潜意识中却更想去实习了。加上近期听到的对互联网方向的各种高薪的讨论，真的有些迷失。未来的一个月内这些纷扰都会慢慢退去，到时候就能集中精力了吧。</p>

        <p>The power cut has just happened. Today is a typical eggache day. I got up early in the morning to attend the phylosophy class, just sitting in the classroom and studying something else. For example, I perused the mathmatic book today, trying to figure out the specific definition of gradient and divergence. Meanwhile, I also focused on various kind of calculus. Contrary to my thorough understanding of them in the past, I’m kind of a tyro right now. Just as the saying goes, to stand still is to retrograde. </p>
<p>At the interval of the class, I left the classroom and went to the lab, and started coding. At first, I worked on rewriting the DRLSE algorithm of edge detection from MATLAB script to C, to boost the executing efficiency. That is quite a hard mission for me, since compared with the easy access to manipulating vectors and matrix of MATLAB, writing something about image in C means that I would suffer from endless loops. Although some features of C++ such as operator overload may someway reduce the difficulty, the pointers make me dizzy. Just before noon, I was tired about it, and I went out for a lunch, then slept for a while.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I mainly dealt with coding problems, including graph and tree. The graph problem was an old one, which I decided to give up after numerous attemps and meditation. The other one was easier, and I finally accomplished it. However, strangely, while I had proven the correctness of my answer in local environment, I couldn’t pass the test of Hihocoder. It really made my confused, especially I paid lots of concentration on it. I solved the problem with a recursive method, which was not efficient enough in my opinion. And due to my lack of practice, I took too may times. In general, I resolved the problem of the ergodic problem.</p>
<p>换回中文说两句，今天被hihocoder的算法折腾得不轻。树的遍历问题还好，关键是遇到稀疏矩阵几乎必跪。看到高分答案里那些用stl库的真心感觉无奈。明日可看点用于稀疏矩阵表示的算法。今日LINUX和图像基本是废的，明日继续。</p>

        <p>Today I attend a campus-talk of Microsoft, which orientes to the potential interns. What makes me so stressed is the fact that most of the staff in Microsoft have a better degree than BS. In contrast, I’m just an undergraduate. Some HUST graduates show their experiences, introduce their daily lifestyle, and help the listener get through the interview. In my point of view, most of the listeners major in computer-related decipline, indicating that they have good coding foundation. On the other hand, I may do better in math and the basic structure of the computer. It seems like that I’m falling behind;therefore, I realize the little chance of this short-term success.</p>
<p>At the day time, I mainly work on major stuff, and help a senior install linux system on his computer. And in the afternoon, I had a talk with Dr. Hu, discussing what I studied last week, the implementation of level set methods in image processing. I sequentially introduce what I read and experiment, and make some complaint about the difficulty. He shows agreement and says that it’s normal. Then we have a short dialogue about the geological transformation about digital image conducted by the deviation involved in photographing. Meanwhile, I come out an idea, where the complexity of humankind intelligence compromises the speed of thinking. More specificly, compared with the layer of artificial neural networks, to recognize or classify more accurately, people need more complicated thinking mechnism. In fact, one has billions of neuron, one of which can perceive the distinct environment and return a positive or negative feedback. It is the complex structure and multiple layers that make all those discrete values seem analog and continuous, resulting in comparative low speed of processing.</p>
<p>Up to now, I haven’t touch anything about the linux system, which means I need to read some after the power cut. That’s all.</p>
<p>表达得有点词不达意，总之，晚上去了一趟的感觉就是有点慌。但慌完了想想又觉得没什么，毕竟没有按照本科毕业就找工作的方向来规划。回来跟软工的一同学聊了一路，感觉学什么都差不多。今日装LINUX装了小半天，看的不多，明天抓紧。</p>
