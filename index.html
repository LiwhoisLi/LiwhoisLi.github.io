        <p>Today is a rainy day. I got up not so early in the morning, and after having a breakfast, I went to the lab. Turning on my surface, I found the upgrade of the problem on hihocoder, so I started coding to solve the problem. Today’s problem was related to merge sort, which I written yesterday. Hence I quickly came up with an idea, and implemented it. However, things didn’t happen as I wanted. At first, I made a stupid mistake where I wrongly valued a variable, conducting to the runtime error over and over again. After I corrected it, I still coudn’t get my answer accepted. In fact, I have had no idea of where my fault is up to now. This strange failure proved me the difference between thorem and practice.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, due to my unexpected failure, I was to some extent disappointed. Hence I stopped studying and surfed the internet. After hours of distraction and sleep, I restarted to studying. I went on watching the open course of ML following yesterday’s progress. And the lecture mainly covered the topic of SVM. To pose the concept of suppor vectors, Andrew Ng introduced general Lagrange mutipliers, which deals with both limit of equations and inequations, as well as the KKT condition. Admittedly, all of the knowledge mentioned in this lecture was quite hard to understand, thus I should recap them regularly. </p>
<p>After dinner, I turned to the field of algorithm, studying some linear time complexity sort algorithm and hash table, and in retrospect, I had a look at some simple data structres such as link list, stack and queue. In my opinion, these sorting methods are so efficient. Despite the unavoidable constraints, each of them has specific use, according to the type of data. And I think the counting method is the most ingenious one.</p>
<p>The hash table is also interesting, so I want to delve into it tomorrow.</p>
<p>今天废话好多。。各种忘词忘得烦，不说了</p>

        <p>What I did today was divided by a lunch. Before it, I was focused on sorting algorithm, writing all of the algorithms I knew including insert sort, bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort. Although I haven’t tested them, I’m confident that I thoroughly understand all of them.</p>
<p>And in the afternoon, after playing cell phones for hours, I began to watch the open course provided by Stanford about Machine learning. This time, I learned naive bayes method, an introduction to neural network, and a getting started of SVM( support vector machine). Naive Bayes is, in Andrew Ng’s words, built on a strong assumption, where each of the words in a text is conditionally independent. Also, according to him, it is a practical learning algorithm. Although the numerical calculations may by someway difficult, the theorem itself is relatively easy, based on Bayes theory. Meanwhile, Andrew Ng introduced another model, which was based on multinomial distribution rather than multivariate gaussian one. This method behaved better in text detection, despite its neglect of the sequential factor.</p>
<p>Then he mentioned neural network, where the working mechnism was similar to logic regression, which was based on sigmoid function. And, in order to solve linearly inseperable problems, multilayer network was introduced, and also the back propagation algorithm, another name of gradient descent algorithm in a different condition. Then, it came to the distance in multidimensional problems, ending with the compare of functional and geometric margin.</p>
<p>To be honest, what I can do now may be only remember some terms without truely understanding them. Thus I need time to digest them. At the end, I want to state something I sadly find out today, which is the fact that maybe the real reason for my poor writing is not the low level in my English, on the other hand, it should be attributed to my inability of organizing words. I should do more writing everyday, both in Chinese and English.</p>
<p>今天看到神经网络的内容，正好与之前在书上看到的对应了起来，果然也印证了我对BP与GDA(Gradient descent algorithm)相类似的看法。但同时，我发现我的遗忘又开始了，即使是当初搞得挺明白的BP也是如此。上午终于把几种O(n2)和O(nlgn)的排序“遍历”了一遍，感觉有点底了。同时还看了场火箭的胜利，可喜可贺。经过几天的酝酿，一个opinion的主题逐渐在我心中形成了，趁这个周末抓紧搞出来吧，尽量双语。ML的数学部分还是有不解的，尤其是对标量求矢量偏导导，结果还能是标量的奇怪问题，应速解决。晚上乱扔了几个球，果然比去完健身房之后准不少。</p>

        <p>Yesterday I suffered from the book Introduction to Algorithm, and was too tired to write something. </p>
<p>Due to the vacancy of classes, I stayed in the lab for whole day, and concentrated on algorithm. Firstly, I attempted to solve some difficult questions corresponding to the intern test. Although I tried my best, I couldn’t even one of them. That helped my realize the great importance of foundation. Thus I started reading the book mentioned above, tried to understand the method and theorem, and sometimes typed some codes on computer to be familiar with them. After dinner, I left the lab and went to the classroom, getting rid of the computer screen and enjoying the pure reading. I quickly browsed most of sorting algorithms and understood them at least in theory.</p>
<p>终于补上了昨天该写的。近日在各方面的问题上陷入了迷茫，到底是图像、算法还是ML或AI，难以抉择啊。自从听了微软的宣讲，虽然认识到希望的渺茫，但潜意识中却更想去实习了。加上近期听到的对互联网方向的各种高薪的讨论，真的有些迷失。未来的一个月内这些纷扰都会慢慢退去，到时候就能集中精力了吧。</p>

        <p>The power cut has just happened. Today is a typical eggache day. I got up early in the morning to attend the phylosophy class, just sitting in the classroom and studying something else. For example, I perused the mathmatic book today, trying to figure out the specific definition of gradient and divergence. Meanwhile, I also focused on various kind of calculus. Contrary to my thorough understanding of them in the past, I’m kind of a tyro right now. Just as the saying goes, to stand still is to retrograde. </p>
<p>At the interval of the class, I left the classroom and went to the lab, and started coding. At first, I worked on rewriting the DRLSE algorithm of edge detection from MATLAB script to C, to boost the executing efficiency. That is quite a hard mission for me, since compared with the easy access to manipulating vectors and matrix of MATLAB, writing something about image in C means that I would suffer from endless loops. Although some features of C++ such as operator overload may someway reduce the difficulty, the pointers make me dizzy. Just before noon, I was tired about it, and I went out for a lunch, then slept for a while.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I mainly dealt with coding problems, including graph and tree. The graph problem was an old one, which I decided to give up after numerous attemps and meditation. The other one was easier, and I finally accomplished it. However, strangely, while I had proven the correctness of my answer in local environment, I couldn’t pass the test of Hihocoder. It really made my confused, especially I paid lots of concentration on it. I solved the problem with a recursive method, which was not efficient enough in my opinion. And due to my lack of practice, I took too may times. In general, I resolved the problem of the ergodic problem.</p>
<p>换回中文说两句，今天被hihocoder的算法折腾得不轻。树的遍历问题还好，关键是遇到稀疏矩阵几乎必跪。看到高分答案里那些用stl库的真心感觉无奈。明日可看点用于稀疏矩阵表示的算法。今日LINUX和图像基本是废的，明日继续。</p>

        <p>Today I attend a campus-talk of Microsoft, which orientes to the potential interns. What makes me so stressed is the fact that most of the staff in Microsoft have a better degree than BS. In contrast, I’m just an undergraduate. Some HUST graduates show their experiences, introduce their daily lifestyle, and help the listener get through the interview. In my point of view, most of the listeners major in computer-related decipline, indicating that they have good coding foundation. On the other hand, I may do better in math and the basic structure of the computer. It seems like that I’m falling behind;therefore, I realize the little chance of this short-term success.</p>
<p>At the day time, I mainly work on major stuff, and help a senior install linux system on his computer. And in the afternoon, I had a talk with Dr. Hu, discussing what I studied last week, the implementation of level set methods in image processing. I sequentially introduce what I read and experiment, and make some complaint about the difficulty. He shows agreement and says that it’s normal. Then we have a short dialogue about the geological transformation about digital image conducted by the deviation involved in photographing. Meanwhile, I come out an idea, where the complexity of humankind intelligence compromises the speed of thinking. More specificly, compared with the layer of artificial neural networks, to recognize or classify more accurately, people need more complicated thinking mechnism. In fact, one has billions of neuron, one of which can perceive the distinct environment and return a positive or negative feedback. It is the complex structure and multiple layers that make all those discrete values seem analog and continuous, resulting in comparative low speed of processing.</p>
<p>Up to now, I haven’t touch anything about the linux system, which means I need to read some after the power cut. That’s all.</p>
<p>表达得有点词不达意，总之，晚上去了一趟的感觉就是有点慌。但慌完了想想又觉得没什么，毕竟没有按照本科毕业就找工作的方向来规划。回来跟软工的一同学聊了一路，感觉学什么都差不多。今日装LINUX装了小半天，看的不多，明天抓紧。</p>

        <p>I go on reading the book which introduces level set method, and mainly focus on the mean curvature flow and some other methods for building the velocity field. Admittedly, it seems not accessible for me, since I cannot even understand the mathmatic expressions. But I still hold on, and endeavor to figure out the method, which is so useful on the image processing area.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, I also pay attention to the linux system, and in process of understanding the virtual memory allocation. Compared with the hardware structure introduced in the theorem of computer class, it is more abstract. To manage the RAM more effectively and enhance the efficiency, the physical memory is artificially divided into lots of logical segment called pages. During the executing of process, the kernel puts the corresponding code into specific pages, building a excutable to record the relation between the code and pages. When needed, the kernel can directly find corresponding pages and execute the code, leaving the need for putting all of codes into the RAM unnecessary. As a result, with the same memory space, there will be more processes executed.</p>
<p>Then, when it comes to the command line arguments, things become easier, since I have already dealt with similar matters. Still, the details mentioned in the book such as how the string of arguments end greatly increase my knowledge scope. And the sections that talk about the environmental variables help me gain a clear idea of a question that has confused me for a long time, which is how the environmental variables work.</p>
<p>Today, while I have spent almost the whole day in the lab, I don’t regard what I obtain enough. In other words, I should learn more. 时间并不算很多，是时候来点鸡血了！</p>
<p>Partial differential equations are truly difficult for me, as well as the convection equation. I should work harder on them.</p>

        <p>Today I get further knowledge of the method called curve evolution, which deals with the edge detection efficiently. To do that, I run the code that I downloaded yesterday, and try to modify the parameters to refine the result. In my opinion, it can be called as dark-technology someway, since the contour of my face is almost completely detected by times of iterations. Tomorrow I may continue the experiment and want to post some pictures online.</p>
<p>In contrast, the theoretical counterparts are too difficult to handle. By reading the Dr. Li’s passage, I start to understand the algorithm, but until now it is just a hazy cognization. And as I always belive that math is the core of image processing, my dilemma should be attributed to my shallow understanding of math. I need to learn more about such things as gradient, divergence and so on.</p>
<p>I’ve also done some reading about the linux system. In order to get deep insight into operating system, I choose to study linux, yet the book mainly talks about the detail such as the number of the errors. Despite their importance, what I want to obtain is a systematical understanding. Hence I skip some pages and directly enter the part of process. After ernest reading, the definition of process is, in my opinion, an abstract entity defined by the kernel, which shares user-space and kernel resources and can execute the program’s code. Each process has a process ID, which, except from some irregularities such as init process, is randomly assigned by the kernel. And the creator of a process is called parent process. Once a process’s parent is orphaned, during its execution, it would be adopted by the init process. So far, I have known all above.</p>
<p>最后用中文感叹一下，刚才翻了一下高数下梯度的部分，居然在里面发现了与水平集方法中不少类似的定义。看来高数真的是工科理论知识无尽的瑰宝啊！以后多看。</p>

        <p>今天可以说是废的，因为大半天的时间被浪费在了改变个人站模板的事上。归根结底还是水平太低，从jekyll变为hexo后，貌似只是主题清爽了点，具体如何实现的我还是一点不懂。</p>
<p>On the other hand, I read the book about level set methods and endeavor to understand the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. To do that, I go through the wiki and search it by google, and find a packet of Matlab codes, whose writer is a Chinese. I’m not confident that I can finally address the question, but what I can do is just working hard.</p>
<p>Before falling asleep, I will read something about linux, trying to memorize more.</p>
<p>以后尽量不这么多废话了，今天确实没干嘛。。</p>
